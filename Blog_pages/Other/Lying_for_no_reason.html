       <p>"So," I hear you ask, "your 9th grade biology teacher told you something misinformed one time and that's what you came here to yell into the void about?" No, of course not.</p>  
            
         <p>Googling the origin of this myth uncovered a tale that absolutely made my blood boil. My former biology teacher, bless his soul, got this information from sources that seemed 
               genuinely reputable. Alas, this is why they are so dangerous. </p>
               
         <p>The story starts in 1975. That year, history's least impressive instance of peer review occurred, 
               leading to the publication of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1117056/">this</a> paper. 
               It supposedly "confirmed" that male hormones cycle, but all it did was show that hormone
               levels fluctuate in, like,,, <i>some</i> dudes. Basically, these authors took blood from 20 guys for a few months and measured their testosterone. 
               Only 12 seemed to have any deviations <i>at all</i>, meaning that the other 8, <i>nearly half the people they tested</i> had 
          no detectable changes.

          You know what would happen if you did 
        the same study on sexually mature people with uteruses?</p>

        <p>If you read any articles that present the existence of the "male period" as a scientific debate, this is the guy they almost always cite to suggest that 
              the phenomenon may be real. So who is he?</p>
            
        <p>Jed Diamond is a therapist who has made a career out of writing about men's health issues. One of his big sellers was a book called “Irritable Male Syndrome,” 
              in which he talks about how changing monthly testosterone levels can cause mental health issues for men. He claims that the research is solid, but <i>shocker</i>,
            it is not. Jed was the first person to describe "Irritable Male Syndrome" in humans. This is noteworthy because <b>he is not a medical doctor</b>, and his
              "research" was <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/do-men-have-periods#1">all based on a testosterone withdrawal phenomenon observed only in a certain kind of sheep</a>.
              As a brief aside, rams are a terrible model organism to use for male reproductive behaviours in humans. Rams go through rut, which means they have demonstrable,
              periodic, reproductive behviours. Human males do not rut.
              
              This is the least of Dr. Diamond's crimes against science, however. Jed claims in many interviews that he's been doing research for decades, but I can't even find 
              <i>any</i> evidence of this. 
              Jed has apparently neither authored <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jed-Diamond">a single peer reviewed publication about "man periods</a>," nor
            even mentions ever doing research in his <a href="https://menalive.com/about-men-alive/">self-written biography</a>.</p>
            
        <p>All that is too say, Jed may be communicating science a little irresponsibly when he says things like:</p>

              their ideas and use them to form newer, better, hypotheses. They don't <b>double down</b> on concepts that have been proven false, and continue to
