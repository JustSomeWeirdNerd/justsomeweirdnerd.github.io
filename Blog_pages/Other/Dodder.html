<p> Dodder, or <i>Cuscuta</i>, is a genus of flowering plant, but if you saw one growing in the wild, you might not realize that. Dodders have no roots or leaves, or and they're not even green! They look more like a bowl of alien spaghetti than any kind of flower you're probably used to. Still, even without the ability to photosynthesize, these plants thrive as obligate parasites. They wind their stems around a host plant and tap into its vascular system with special organs called haustoria. Haustoria are similar to roots, but instead of taking in water and nutrients from the soil, they take them directly from the xylem and phloem of other plants (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00045/full">Kaiser et al, 2015</a>).</p>

<p>Among angiosperms, we think that haustoria-based parasitism evolved twelve independent times. To date, we have recorded over 4,700 species that fit this definition (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tax.12195#:~:text=4750%20species%20of%20flowering%20plants,Nickrent%20%26%20Musselman%2C%202016).">Nickrent, 2020</a>). That's about 1% of <i>all</i> flowering plants (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04721-8">Sun et al, 2018</a>). So what makes dodder so special? Well, in 2018 yellow dodder became the first species of parasitic plant to have its full genome sequenced (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04344-z">Vogel et al, 2018</a>), and the findings were... weird.</p>

<div class="cent_content">
	<h2>The <i>Cuscuta</i> Genome</h2>
</div>

      <div class="content">
<p>One of the many strange things about dodder's genome is that it lacks over 1,000 of the most highly conserved genes in plants. I.e., genes that are considered to be the most fundamental for life. Specifically, the missing genes seem related to root and leaf development, nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and immunity.</p>


<p>While losing these types of genes would be catastrophic for free-living plants, parasitic dodder does just fine without the ability to produce its own food or grow the organs necessary to do so. Additionally, because most plants become infected with pathogens through their roots and leaves, dodder is not especially at risk for infection, making it less dependent on immune genes (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04721-8">Sun et al, 2018</a>). This is an example of "Regressive Evolution:" the removal of useless features over time. This process is how whales lost their legs, and how humans lost our tails. Regressive evolution acting on many different traits at once is much less common, but not unique to dodder; in fact, many parasites are known to have undergone this type of reductive change (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04721-8">Sun et al, 2018</a>).</p>

<p>What's far more interesting about this plucky little parasite is that it seems to be <b>stealing genes from its hosts, and incorporating them into its own DNA.</b> Yellow dodder specifically contains 64 genes that appear to come from at least 32 other species of plants. These genes have very similar sequences to those in species that aren't very closely related to dodders. Because it's been so long since they shared a common ancestor, the odds are essentially zero that their gene sequences would be so similar as a result of shared ancestry. On top of this, these genes resembled those in the species that dodder parasitizes the most. This made scientists think that dodder is somehow taking genes from its hosts, and incorporating them into its own genome. This is an example of something called horizontal gene transfer (HGT): any transmission of genetic material between organisms that <b>doesn't</b> involve a parent passing genes to their offspring.</p>


<p>HGT is fairly common in bacteria and archaea. These single-celled organisms can directly exchange DNA by forming an anatomical structure called a conjugation pilus (picture). Viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages, can also pass genetic material from one host to the next. However, the finding that HGT was occurring rampantly between dodder and its hosts was a bit of a shock, since most scientists thought that horizontal gene transfer between two large, multicellular organisms was extremely rare until quite recently. However, newer studies are starting to suggest that HGT may actually be more common between plants than anyone previously imagined (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009612/">El Baidouri et al, 2014</a>) and (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/10/12/3196/5165405">Kado and Innan, 2018</a>).</p>

	<h2>The Outlying Questions: Why and How?</h2>
</div>

      <div class="content">

<p>At this point, very little is understood about exactly why or how dodder is stealing genes from its hosts. Some hypothesize that horizontal gene transfer may aid evolution in two ways. The first is that taking in a host plant's genes may help parasites camoflauge themselves from a host's immune system. If the parasite is making the plant's own genes, they won't be detectable as a foreign elements. The second is that stealing a host's own immune genes may help it actively fight off the host's immune system during infection: essentially, fighting fire with fire.</p>

<p>Still, our understanding of <i>how</i> this is occurring is even more barren. One possibility is that simply being in close proximity makes it easier for dodders to become infected with the same pathogens as their hosts, as pathogens are known to move genetic material laterally. Another idea is that DNA-containing mitochondria may be able to move through haustoria. Experiments that graft two species of plant together have shown that mitochondria can move between species through cell-to-cell connections (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/12/3395">Gurdon et al, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>All in all, we're a long way from being able to prove any of these ideas, and a lot more research needs to be done before we really understand these weird little plants and their even weirder genomes.</p>
