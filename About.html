  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hello! I am Kat! I am a huge big nerd who has paid a lot of money for multiple pieces of paper that tell prospective employers that I know a lot about DNA. I like other topics too, but I do not have any pieces of paper that profess my mastery over them.

I started this blog because I love reading and writing about science. I am constantly in awe of the simultaneous breathtakingness and absolute buffoonery of the scientific process. Scientists are the weirdest, silliest people of all time, and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that all the relatable, humanizing, hilariousness of our daily lives gets stripped away in the publication process. My aim is to communicate science the way I see it from the inside looking out: exasperating, bizarre, hysterical, and abosolutely, incredibly beautiful.<p1>
