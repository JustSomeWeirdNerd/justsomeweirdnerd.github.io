    <p>I am a huge big nerd who has paid a lot of money for multiple pieces of paper that tell prospective employers that I know a lot about DNA. I like other topics too, but I do not have any pieces of paper that profess my mastery over them.</p>
    <p>I started this blog because I love reading and writing about science. I am constantly in awe of the simultaneous breathtakingness and absolute buffoonery of the scientific process. Scientists are the weirdest, silliest people of all time, and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that all the relatable, humanizing, hilariousness of our daily lives gets stripped away in the publication process. My aim is to communicate science the way I see it from the inside looking out: exasperating, bizarre, hysterical, and abosolutely, incredibly beautiful.</p>

      <h2><u>What are your qualifications?</u></h2>
    </div>
      
    <p>I have an honours B.Sc in Biology and am currently writing my M.Sc thesis in Genome Science & Technology. Both degrees were/are being obtained at world top-40 universities.</p>
    <p>But okay, I get good grades. Maybe that was agiven from the name of the website, huh? I've also been actively participating in research since I was 17 years old, working in a grand total of four labs in three cities and two countries. I've given talks to children about my research, written articles about how to talk about science for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and have even fact checked a couple of wildlife documentaries that aired internationally. I am not, however, going to link to any of that stuff because I don't want my silly and occaisionally vulgar blog to come up when employers google my name.</p>

      <h2><u>Why should I trust you?</u></h2>
    </div>
      
    <p>Well... you shouldn't! Not that I'm unqualified to be a science communicator. But who knows? Maybe I'm not a 24 year old graduate student named Kat? Maybe I'm a know-it-all 14 year old
    on a powertrip. This is, after all, the internet. Alas sweet reader, you don't have to trust me, for everything I write will be sourced with the highest quality peer reviewed articles,
    piping hot and fresh out of the autoclave.</p>
