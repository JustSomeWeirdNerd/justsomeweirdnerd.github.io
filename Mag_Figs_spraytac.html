    <p>Today's Magnificent Figure comes from a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3785820/">2013 paper</a> published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface by researchers from Tsinghua University in Beijing. The figure was used to help explain how the "Spraytec System" works. Basically, it uses a laser to measure the volume and number of liquid particles that come out of a test subject's face when they sneeze. Very complex concept!</p>
    <p>Yes. For some reason, simply writing, "you sneeze into the laser and it measures the sneeze" would suffice neither for Han et al, 2013, nor for the three other career scientists who peer reviewed this masterpiece of a figure. A+ work to all parties involved. </p>
