      <h1>How to Avoid Fake Science as a Layperson</h1>
  <\div> 
  <p>For non-scientists, learning about science online can be rather daunting. What's real information? What's an exaggeration of a real fact, and what's simply made up nonsense? The internet is full of crap science: even on websites with reputable names or ones that seem fancy and expensive. We've all seen those ad-filled clickbait websites that talk about how chocolate cures cancer one day, then talk about how it causes cancer the next day. But there's a great wide spectrum of reliability between the latest research published on the cover of Nature and your Great Aunt's rambly blog about how 5G towers are mind-control devices. Where do you draw the line on that spectrum? And how do you even know where things fall on it?</p>
  <p>A term you probably hear thrown around a lot when it comes to scientific writing is "peer review." But what is peer review, and why is it considered the "gold standard" of scientific writing? Well, science ultimately aims to learn things about the universe from a completely unbiased lens. Humans are biased by nature, though, and it's not always possible to be totally neutral. When scientists design experiments, we are supposed to do it in the way will limit as much of our human feelings and preconcieved notions as possible. However, sometimes we miss things. So before any research is considered true science, the research will be sent to three scientists in your field who don't know you and have no conflict of interest with your research. They will read through what you've done: every method, every step, every statistical analysis. They will make sure it really is unbiased, and that your conclusions accurately match the data in your study. Only once all three scientists agree that your research is good can it be published in a journal. In addition to this high level of scrutiny, peer reviewed publications are required to contain a description of every test the researchers did to produce their data, how they did it, and what the raw numerical results of each test were. In this way, every scientist who reads the paper can make up their own mind about whether or not it really is unbiased science. Peer reviewed scientific publications are the only type of scientific writing where someone can form a true opinion about the quality of the research -- because they contain every single aspect of that research. This is why they are the gold standard. However, peer reviewed publications are difficult for even veteran scientists to read. For the average person, it's like reading ancient Greek. So we have to rely on more digestible scientific writing, but it's not always easy to tell how good that is... </p>

      <h2>Presenting: Sci Comms Quality Calculator©<\h2>
  <\div>
  <p>For your use, I've made a simple web tool that can help anyone identify the quality of a piece of non-peer reviewed scientific writing.<\p>
  <p>Step 1: Before reading the article, scan it for immediate red flags. If you see EITHER at least one reference to a publication in a peer-reviewed journal OR at least one direct quote from a scientist (the scientist must be listed with their full credentials and their current place of employment so readers can find information about them an judge how credible they seem), DO NOT READ THE ARTICLE. Just don't. The information is wrong. Don't let it into you brain.<\p>
  <p>Step 2: If the article has passed the cursory exam for validity, proceed with caution, and fill out the Sci Comms Quality Calculator© (a Just Some Weird Nerd exclusive production):</p>
